Greetings Tarek,

the buzzer and the motor is not running on proteus since it gives grey color on the pins connected for both the motor and the buzzer , but the code is OK on eclipse with the timer0 .

I have tried many days to fix the problem but I couldn't fix it .

I am Sorry for the delay, because I tried to do my best with this project independently.

Regards,
Khaled
